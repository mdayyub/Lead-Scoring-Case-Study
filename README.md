# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

### Problem Statement
* An X Education needs assistance in choosing the prospects that have the best chance of becoming paying clients. The business wants us to develop a model in which each lead is given a lead score, with higher lead scores indicating a higher likelihood of conversion and lower lead scores indicating a lower likelihood of conversion. The goal lead conversion rate has been estimated by the CEO to be in the range of 80%.

### Goals of Case Study
* Create a logistic regression model to give each lead a lead number between 0 and 100 that the business can use to target prospective leads. In contrast, a lesser score would indicate that the advantage is cold and unlikely to convert, while a higher score would indicate that the lead is hot and most likely to convert.
